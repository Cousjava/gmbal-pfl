This project contains a simple example of a client using
the logex library.  It contains:

- lib: a directory, which contains pfl.jar,
  which contains all of my libraries
  (we'll worry about minimizing this later)

- src: a directory containing the example package

- build.xml: a simple ant file that builds and runs the example
  and generates the .properties files.  It defines the following targets:
  - build: build the sample
    - this includes generating the properties files.
  - run: run the sample
  - all (default): build and run
  - clean: clean up build artifacts

- build: a directory contains the compiled code and the generated
  properties files.

Dependencies.

The WrapperGenerator depends on only a couple of proxy
handling classes in org.glassfish.basic.proxy.

The ExceptionResourceGenerator has more dependencies:
- The argument parser class
- Some file scanning utilities
- and of course the rest of the logex classes

Tool and library classes are kept separate, so there is no
need to have compile-time tools present in runtime jars.
